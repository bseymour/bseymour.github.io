  <p>unslump.me is a place to find and manage words of inspiration - bringing you back to yourself.... and maybe, one day, a community of support for fostering and nurturing well-being.</p>

  </h1>

  <p>Code Parents is for people with little or no prior computing experience, who would like to be better prepared to encourage and support children in starting to explore coding.</p>

  <p>While volunteering in primary schools I often find that parents are intrigued but mystified by the activities that their children were exploring in the code club. Many want to know more, but don&#8217;t know where to start &#8211; this site is for anyone in a similar position. Despite the website name, we want to help everyone, not just parents, but couldn&#8217;t find an all-inclusive, yet short and meaningful domain name.</p>

  <p>
    The < picture > element and srcset & sizes attributes finally offer a standards based approach to real-world Responsive Images. The Project&#8217;s website <a title="ResponsiveImag.es" href="http://responsiveimag.es/" target="_blank">ResponsiveImag.es</a>  explores the new solutions available to us, provides real-world examples, and links into utilising Dynamic Imaging to make this truly practical. I&#8217;ve also been <a title="Presenting on Responsive Images" href="http://benseymour.com/speaking/" target="_blank">presenting on the subject</a> at developer meet-ups and geek nights.
