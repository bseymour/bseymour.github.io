<blockquote><p>&#8220;Distractions keep us from:<br />
&#8211; Wanting what we want to want<br />
&#8211; Doing what we want to do<br />
&#8211; Being who we want to be&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to live each day without all the tensions and worries that stop us noticing how sweet the world is.&#8221; : About Time</p>

And Eternity in an hour

<p>“The goal of a startup is to find the sweet-spot where minimum product and viable product meet — get people to fall in love with you. Over time, you listen to your customers, make improvements and raise the bar on what viable means — making it more expensive for competitors to jump in.” &#8211; Jon Radoff</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8211;Family&#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8220;To bring up a child in the way he should go, travel that way yourself once in a while&#8221; : Josh Billings</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If &#8211; Kipling</strong></span> IF you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don&#8217;t deal in lies, Or being hated, don&#8217;t give way to hating, And yet don&#8217;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream &#8211; and not make dreams your master; If you can think &#8211; and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you&#8217;ve spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build &#8217;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: &#8216;Hold on!&#8217;</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, &#8216; Or walk with Kings &#8211; nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds&#8217; worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that&#8217;s in it, And &#8211; which is more &#8211; you&#8217;ll be a Man, my son!</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <em>Tao Te Ching</em></span></p>
<p>Simplicity :: patience :: compassion</p>
<p>&#8220;Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When there is no desire, all things are at peace&#8221;</p>
